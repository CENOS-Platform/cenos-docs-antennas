For geometry manipulations *CENOS Antenna Design* uses a very strong geometry editor - *FreeCAD*. This editor is used with both *Import CAD* and *Geometry Editor*, so **it is important for us to understand how to work with FreeCAD**. 

**Watch a short video on how to use FreeCAD for CENOS Antenna Design app**:

## Geometry import

Sometimes when building an antenna simulation, you will already have a pre-made geometry, which you will want to use.

---

### DXF/STEP

You can easily import your CAD in **DXF** or **STEP** file formats.

**To import such files**, open *Geometry Editor* and simply **drag & drop** your geometry in *FreeCAD*!

<p align="center">

![drag n drop](assets/quickstart/drag-drop.gif)

</p>

---

### .NEC

If you have a ***.NEC*** (or other format) file, you can import it from the Part module.

<p align="center">

</p>

![NEC import](assets/quickstart/83.png)

</p>

---

### Unit scaling

CAD files which are imported in *FreeCAD* must be in the **correct units - milimeters**. If your geometry is **scaled incorrectly**, you **need to rescale it**, otherwise meshing problems will occur.

To scale your geometry:

1. Switch to **Draft** workbench.

<p align="center">

![NEC import](assets/quickstart/94.png)

</p>

2. In *Tree View* select your geometry and click **Clone** (this function will create a **scalable copy** of your geometry).

<p align="center">

![NEC import](assets/quickstart/95.png)

</p>


3. Once the clone object is created, **scale your geometry** in *Properties*. Make sure that the scale factor is the same in every direction to avoid distorting your geometry!

<p align="center">

![NEC import](assets/quickstart/96.png)

</p>


:::note
As an alternative to geometry scaling you can use **Scale** function, but it will **not work on every geometry**, as opposed to **Clone** approach.

<p align="center">

![NEC import](assets/quickstart/97.png)

</p>

### CAD compound check

If you have imported one or more CAD files and **stumble into a problem either at meshing or anywhere else**, it might be an **indicator that the CAD file is actually not a solid, but compound of surfaces**, which can cause problems for FreeCAD.

To check if your CAD is a solid:

1. Click on the object in *Tree View* and open **Python console** (*right-click* on the icon toolbar and select *Python console*)

2. On the lower right corner *Python console* will open. Write **len(obj.Shape.Solids)** and click enter.

3. Take a look of the output.

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled23.png](assets/quickstart/93.png)

</p>

The number of solids indicate how many volumes are there. If this number is high, **evaluate the quality of your CAD file**!

:::note
If you get an error message an cannot display the number of solids, click **Edit â†’ Send to python console**, and redo the previous steps!
:::

## Component Library

You can use **CENOS Component Library** templates to **build patch or connector geometries**.

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled23.png](assets/quickstart/54.png)

</p>

### Patch antenna

**Select the patch you want to build** and click **Create**. **Fill out the template** parameters and click **OK** to build your geometry!

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled23.png](assets/quickstart/84.png)

</p>

---

### Coaxial edge connector

Select **Coaxial edge connector** and click **Create**.

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled23.png](assets/quickstart/55.png)

</p>

Connector will be automatically placed in your workbench, so you can **position it** by left-clicking on it in the tree view and selecting **Transform**.

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled7.png](assets/quickstart/Untitled7.png)

</p>

To **change the size** of the connector, select it in tree view and edit the **Property** tab to suit your application.

<p align="center">

![assets/quickstart/Untitled23.png](assets/quickstart/57.png)

</p>

## Sketches

A **sketch is the base for almost all geometrical objects** you can create, **including geometries for antennas**, which is why we need to know how to create one.

---

### From scratch

In *FreeCAD* you can create sketches in **Sketcher workbench**, which you can access directly through the shortcut icon:

<p align="center">

![Sketcher](assets/quickstart/35.png)

</p>

Once in the workbench, click **Create a new sketch**.

<p align="center">

![Sketch new](assets/quickstart/37.png)

</p>

**Select the plane where you want to create you sketch**, and you can start to draw the actual geometry.

<p align="center">

![Sketch plane](assets/quickstart/38.png)

</p>

*FreeCAD* offers a large variety of tools designed to easily and precisely create any geometry.

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/39.png)

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/40.png)

:::tip
Hold down **Alt** to rotate the camera in sketch view
:::

Draw your antenna geometry, and, once you are done, click **Close**.

<p align="center">

![Close sketch](assets/quickstart/41.png)

</p>

---

### On volumes

In some cases **it is beneficial to create a sketch on an already created volume**, for example, for PCB antennas. Once you have created a 3D volume, for example, a box, you can select one surface on which to create you sketch.

:::note
The geometry you create will be partitioned upon sending it to CENOS, which means that **sketches created on top of volumes will appear as separate surfaces in CENOS**!

For example, you don't need to create an extrusion for patch, as it is enough to create only a sketch for it.
:::

In the **Part** workbench select the face on which you want to draw.

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/42.png)

Click **Sketcher workbench**.

<p align="center">

![Sketcher](assets/quickstart/35.png)

</p>

Then click **Create a new sketch**.

<p align="center">

![Sketch new](assets/quickstart/37.png)

</p>

Click **OK** to *FlatFace* definition, and start to draw.

<p align="center">

![FlatFace](assets/quickstart/43.png)

</p>

:::tip
Hold down **Alt** to rotate the camera in sketch view
:::

Once you have finished drawing your sketch, simply **Close** it and you are done!

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/44.png)

## 3D volumes

For a lot of times it will be necessary to **create 3D geometries, not only 2D sketches**. Fortunately 3D modeling in *FreeCAD* is very straightforward!

:::warning important
When creating volumes, make sure that they do not overlap with each other. **Overlapping volume objects are forbidden**!
:::

---

### Primitives

For the **simplest volume objects** like cubes, spheres or cylinders, *FreeCAD* offers an easy way of creating such geometries. As you open *FreeCAD*, you will be automatically put in **Part** workbench. There you can simply **select any geometry you want and build it**.

<p align="center">

![Primitives](assets/quickstart/45.png)

</p>

As you select an object, it will be built with pre-defined size. **To change the size of your geometry**, select your object and change its properties.

<p align="center">

![Properties](assets/quickstart/47.png)

</p>

---

### Extrusion

For **more complicated geometries** it is possible to draw a sketch and create a 3D volume object from that sketch. There are multiple functions for this procedure, but the most commonly used one is *Extrusion*.

To use *Extrusion*, you need to **first create a sketch you need**.

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/50.png)

Then switch to **Part workbench**

<p align="center">

![Part workbench](assets/quickstart/48.png)

</p>

and click **Extrude a selected sketch**.

<p align="center">

![Extrude icon](assets/quickstart/49.png)

</p>


In *Extrude* properties window define the **extrusion lenght**, check **Create solid** and select **Sketch** as a shape to extrude. Once done, click apply.

<p align="center">

![Extrude properties](assets/quickstart/51.png)

</p>

Now you have succesfully created a complex 3D object!

![assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png](assets/quickstart/52.png)

## Geometry parameters

A very useful thing to have is **parameterized geometry**. This way you can **create your geometry and dynamically change it through parameters** without the need to rebuild everything.

You can **define parameters** in the *Cenos Parameters* spreadsheet where you can use various units and/or mathematical equations for the values.

<p align="center">

![Parameters](assets/quickstart/Untitled27.png)

</p>

:::tip
To navigate between *Cenos Parameters* and geometry preview, use the tabs below the spreadsheet.
![assets/quickstart/Untitled28.png](assets/quickstart/53.png)
:::

To **use these parameters**, click the *Formula Editor* button in the value field and then enter `CenosParameters.name`

![assets/quickstart/Untitled28.png](assets/quickstart/Untitled28.png)

:::note
For now, to update the parameters, you will have to open FreeCAD and re-send the geometry to CENOS. In the next CENOS Antenna Design versions parameters will be accessable directly from CENOS interface.
:::

## Getting the geometry to CENOS

Once you have finished the geometry, you need to send the mesh to CENOS. To do that:

1. **Select all final objects** in the tree view.

2. Click **Geometry to CENOS**.

3. As geometry is being sent to CENOS, **FreeCAD study will be automatically saved** in the simulation folder, so you can close it.
