**You don’t need a supercomputer** to run antenna design simulations with CENOS. Intel i5 or i7 (or similar) are good enough. **The faster processor you have, the faster calculation will go**.


We recommend to have at least 16 GB RAM to calculate 3D cases, 32 GB is better. Actually, **the more RAM you have, the bigger (more complex) 3D geometries you can simulate**. Some of our customers use 128 GB machines and that’s like for rocket-science-cases. Test


| Hadware component          | Requirements     |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| **GPU**                    | Graphics card that supports OpenGL 3.3        |
| **CPU**                    | Intel i5 or i7 (or similar) are good enough. |
| **RAM**                    | Minimum 8GB RAM recommended for calculations   |
| **Disk space**             | 5 GB disk space required for program installation (3.5 GB third-party apps, 0.5 GB CENOS app). For calculation results 10GB of disk space per case is recommended; it will differ based on your geometry and settings     |
