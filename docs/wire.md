### Wire antennas
:::note
If you have a ***.NEC*** (or other format) file, you can import it from the Part module (pic)
:::

To create a wire antenna from scratch:
* Create any planar elements in sketcher
* Set sketch position in its properties (Attachment→Placement→Position)
* For edges in 3 dimensions, use Draft Workbench→Drafting→Line. Then change its endpoints in its properties.
* To create helixes or spirals use Part→Create Primitives (pic)
* To create a wire with volume from the edges use ***Wire thickness*** (pic) in Part Workbench
